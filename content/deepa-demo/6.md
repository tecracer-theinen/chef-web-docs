# Introduction

## What does it do?

It provides a **TCEform** wizard for adding industry standard dummy text
to selected form fields in **TYPO3**. The dummy content is the classic
\"*Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\...\"* taken from the website
\" [www.lipsum.org](http://www.lipsum.org/) \". It also provides a
selection of 40 dummy pictures.

## Screenshots

The extension will add wizard icons to all *header*, *bodytext*,
*caption*, *description*, *keyword*, *title* and so on.

### Fields of Content Elements and Pages:

![img-1](media/image1.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="7.388194444444444in"}

-   By clicking the icons dummy text is put into the associated form
    field.

-   Clicking images in the image matrix will add the image to the image
    list and attached to the record when saved. Images are found in 7
    different aspect ratios.

\'userFunc\' =\>
\'EXT:lorem_ipsum/class.tx_loremipsum_wiz.php:tx_loremipsum_wiz-\>main\',

# Manual

## Inserting \"Lorem Ipsum\...\"

In records for pages, content elements and page overlay records you
simply click the \"Lipsum\" button to the right of input fields where
Lorem Ipsum applies. See screenshot above.

# Dummy content for localized websites

If you are developing localized websites it can be practical to insert
dummy content that is visually different from the default language. It
makes it easy for you to see if your application works correctly if you
use russian or asian characters as dummy data. It will even help to
expose places where you do not handle characters sets correctly.

You configure other types of dummy content than the default \"Lorem
Ipsum\" kind (which is totally ASCII based) in the System Language
records. All records that refer to this system language as their
language definition will now use that type of dummy content instead.
